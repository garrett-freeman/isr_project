# isr_project

This was a project for my information storage and retrieval course. We were assigned to create a program that:
* scrapes a website
* Creates a new folders with all documents in the website
* Creates tokens of all words and a bigram index of all words
* Allows a user to search a term and find the location of the term in the docs
